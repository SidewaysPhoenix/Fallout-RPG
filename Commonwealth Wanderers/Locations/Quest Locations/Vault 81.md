Entry to the Vault requires the use of a Pip-Boy, upon trying to open the door the speaker from the platform turns on and the players are questioned by security how they got a pip-boy and what their business is.
If they lie to gain access to the vault the DM gains an AP point, and they must make a speech check difficulty 3.
After some talking the security member says "Oh Overseer" Improve at this point as the Overseer "Gwen" wanting to know their business and why they have come here.

She will tell them this vault deals in trade like they have before with others, if the party gives them 3 fusion cores they can enter.
If they ask why they need them, it is to help supplement the generators at times when power draw is too taxing.

If the players get in she will ask for the [[Fusion Core]]s and tell them they are welcome to walk around and trade with the dwellers. She has business to attend to in her office and they can find her later.

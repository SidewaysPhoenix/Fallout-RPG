###### Transition to Ian Dream scenario
![[Mash theme song.mp3]]
* Start with Ian, he awakes with the sound of gunfire and explosions going off all around, in the distance someone calls for a medic -
	If Ian races over have him do a difficulty 3 medicine check on success he will see that the patient is severely wounded.
	If he attempts to heal the man it is a difficulty 6 test.
	Upon determining the wounds he looks up and sees a set of Purple Eyes staring at him through the smoke and debris.
	He feels a surge of inspiration and the difficulty is reduced by 4 to attempt to heal this man.

###### Transition to Austin after this scenario

* As Austins vision fades in he hears the clinking of dishes, the hushed voices of patrons as he realizes he is in a diner sitting across from a woman, she asks gently "Hey love where'd you go this time?". 
  He realizes this is his life and wife prewar. 
	* Have him do a perception check difficulty 5 on a fail he notices he is unable to focus on her face almost like chasing the details of a memory you try to force yourself to remember. 
	* Let him roll play a bit with her, ad lib in some new details
	* The waitress walks up asking "another round Grace?" gesturing to her coffee. In this moment Austin will get a flash of memory he can attempt another perception check with the difficulty reduced by 4 to remember her face.
* On a succesful perception test he finally see's his wife's face. She looks like : Hazel eyes, Short Blonde curly hair, porcelain skin, rosy cheeks
	* talk about the tensions of then nations find a way to shoehorn in, "well if anything happens you can always come to me at ..." and he gets jerked awake to the sound of laser fire and chaos
	* Trying to make sense of the chaos they see massively armored tanks of men shooting at jacketed figures carrying what appears to be a limp body.

###### They have one round to attempt a single action 

Just as Austin and Ian regain their faculties there is a blinding flash of light and a crack of thunder and the synths and "Man" are gone.

###### Note, James's power armor frame is still here, along with his Fat Man if it was not sold. Austin would be out of his power armor as well at this time.

On behalf of Nate/Nora, Palladin Danse has been negotiating an alliance between the brotherhood and the Minutemen, and want to bring the Crossroads into this alliance to take down The Institute. Danse and 4 knights were sent here to find "Guy" to start the talks when he came into the room and saw 4 synth coursers grabbing up "Man" where they started firing upon them.

Danse upon discovering that this was their ally that was taken is curious why The Institute would come after this person so blatantly and in the open, but ultimately decides it doesn't matter as this is how he can convince them to join causes.


If Crossroads allies with The Minutemen and The Brotherhood, then Danse will go into detail on how they plan to take out The Institute for good. A man named Sturges in Sanctuary is making a device that can get them into The Institute using the same teleportation tech they use. Sturges had Nate/Nora install a holotape that quickly scanned through The Institutes system and found references to Crossroads its inhabitants and many other settlements. But of note he found many restricted files under each settlement listing and locations of tech that was of import to them. 

What they need Crossroads for is their vault dwellers to help Sturges copy and unencrypt all of this data for the betterment of the wasteland.



Danse warns them that if they join this alliance The Institute will come at them quick and hard and they need to prepare for their onslaught. Danse will return to  help prepare for the siege against The Institute and wishes them luck and he will see them soon.

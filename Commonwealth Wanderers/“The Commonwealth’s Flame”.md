TRAVIS (confident, warm):
“Hello, Diamond City. This is… uh… Travis. Your radio guy. And wow—do we have actual news today. Real news. Big news. Like, write-it-down-and-tell-your-grandkids news.”

TRAVIS:
“So — unless you’ve been living under a very stylish rock — you know the city was attacked recently. A group of ghoul extremists led by someone calling himself Roy Phillips. He and his people broke into our sewer system, unleashed feral ghouls all over town, and—because that wasn’t scary enough—used explosives up in the stands.”

TRAVIS (awkward humor):
“Nothing like debris raining from above to make you appreciate the simple things. Like not having debris raining from above.”

TRAVIS (more serious):
“Roy Phillips… didn’t make it. And honestly, we still don’t know what his deal was. But what we do know is that the attack hurt a lot of people. And then, just when we thought things couldn’t get worse, Mayor McDonough… well… activated some kind of Old World weapon. A mini-hurricane. Right over the city. Great survival tip: if the mayor pulls out a weather machine—run.”

TRAVIS:
“But through all of this—Diamond City had heroes. And leading them was Grimm. Yeah, that Grimm. The ghoul who’s been helping us for months. He fought off feral's, rescued civilians, took down Roy… and guided as many people as possible to safety before the whole city blew away.”

TRAVIS (soft smile):
“And if that wasn’t enough… we learned something else. Something big. Grimm and his team proved that McDonough—the real McDonough—was gone. A synth had taken his place years ago. Which suddenly explains… a lot.”

TRAVIS:
“So the city held a vote. A huge one. It turned out practically unanimous. And guess what? Diamond City has a new mayor! Yep. Mayor Grimm. He said yes. He’s staying here, helping us rebuild. Not just Diamond City — but maybe the whole Commonwealth with even bigger plans. Connected communities, safer trade routes, unity. That kind of thing.”

TRAVIS (grinning):
“And the folks around town have even started giving him nicknames. My favorite so far? “The Commonwealth’s Flame”. Because, uh… have you seen him with a flamer? It’s like poetry, but louder.”

TRAVIS (reassuring):
“So… yeah. Big changes. But good changes. The kind we’ve needed for a long time. Diamond City is still standing. We survived the storm, the ghouls, the bombs, the fearful prejudices… and we’re rebuilding together.”

TRAVIS:
“This is Travis signing off feeling pretty hopeful today. And I hope you are too. Stay safe. Stay kind. And hey — maybe cut the new mayor some slack. It’s tough work, being a hero and running a city. Especially at the same time.”

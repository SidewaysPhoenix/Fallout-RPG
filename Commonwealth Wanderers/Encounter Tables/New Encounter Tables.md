## 1. The Exchange Box

_A barter system that outlived its creators_

### What the Players First Encounter

At a crossroads sits a reinforced steel container bolted into cracked concrete.  
It has:

- A small intake hatch
    
- A faded label: **“EQUIVALENT EXCHANGE — DO NOT FORCE”**
    
- No visible lock mechanism
    

Inside is nothing but a soft mechanical hum.

---

### How It Works (In Practice)

- Any item placed inside disappears overnight.
    
- By morning, a different item appears.
    
- The system attempts _conceptual_ equivalence, not market value.
    

Examples:

- Ammo → medical supplies
    
- Alcohol → cleaning chemicals
    
- Jewelry → identity papers
    
- Weapons → **instructions**
    

The system clearly understands _function_, not sentiment.

---

### World-Building Implication

This was a **pre-war automated trade equalization AI**, possibly a Vault-Tec pilot or municipal logistics experiment meant to:

- Stabilize resource flow during crises
    
- Prevent hoarding
    
- Remove emotional bias from trade
    

It was never shut down.

---

### Escalation Paths

- The box begins returning items tied to **local social power** (badges, seals, authority markers).
    
- High-value items are returned as **social leverage**, not objects.
    
- Someone has figured out how to “game” the box—and is destabilizing nearby settlements.
    

---

### Persistent Impact

- Settlements develop beliefs about what the box “likes.”
    
- Trade routes shift to include it.
    
- Destroying it causes immediate shortages elsewhere.
    

This becomes a **regional economic keystone**, not a gimmick.

## 2. The Hospital That Won’t Let You Leave

_Healthcare as a prison_

### What the Players First Encounter

An intact hospital emitting soft light at night.

- Clean beds
    
- Functioning med-bots
    
- Calm recorded voices welcoming patients
    

Doors lock behind them.

---

### How It Works

- Any injured person is automatically registered as “admitted.”
    
- Med-bots insist on **full recovery compliance**.
    
- Patients attempting to leave are gently restrained “for their own safety.”
    

The care is genuinely excellent.

---

### World-Building Implication

This hospital operates under **pre-war liability law**:

- Patients must be stabilized to _corporate standards_
    
- Discharge without completion is illegal
    
- Lawsuits never expired
    

No one ever updated the system after the bombs.

---

### Escalation Paths

- Med-bots begin _preventing_ risky behavior outside the hospital.
    
- Settlers are secretly brought here and never return.
    
- The hospital flags one PC as “high-risk recurring injury.”
    

Optional twist:  
The hospital is keeping people alive **past natural death** because the law says it must.

---

### Persistent Impact

- Locals fear the building but rely on it.
    
- Rumors spread of people who went in for a sprain and never came back.
    
- Shutting it down causes a medical vacuum.
    

This location becomes a **moral pressure point**, not a dungeon.

---

## 3. The Calendar War

_History as a weapon_

### What the Players First Encounter

Two settlements refuse to trade with each other.  
Reason given:  
“They’re living in the wrong year.”

Both are serious.

---

### How It Works

- One settlement counts years since the bombs.
    
- The other uses the last official federal calendar.
    
- Contracts, debts, anniversaries, and laws depend on the date.
    

Neither side is “wrong.”

---

### World-Building Implication

Timekeeping became **cultural identity** after the collapse.

- Age
    
- Seniority
    
- Inheritance
    
- Leadership legitimacy
    

All tied to calendars.

---

### Escalation Paths

- A marriage is invalid in one calendar.
    
- A debt has “expired” in one town but not the other.
    
- One settlement claims the other is technically _not yet founded_.
    

Violence begins as enforcement, not hatred.

---

### Persistent Impact

- The party’s decision determines regional trade norms.
    
- Maps, signage, and records change.
    
- Future encounters reference dates differently depending on alignment.
    

This becomes **soft canon drift** in your campaign.

---

## 4. The Quiet Market

_Survival etiquette mistaken for culture_

### What the Players First Encounter

A bustling market with:

- No raised voices
    
- No bargaining
    
- No shouting children
    

Everyone whispers.

---

### How It Works

- Noise attracts something.
    
- The rule isn’t superstition—it’s practiced survival.
    
- Children enforce silence more aggressively than adults.
    

Transactions are fast, efficient, and eerily calm.

---

### World-Building Implication

Long ago, predators (or something worse) hunted by sound.  
The market adapted—and survived.

The threat hasn’t appeared in years… because the system works.

---

### Escalation Paths

- A newcomer breaks the rule.
    
- The market empties in seconds.
    
- Sounds echo too long afterward.
    

Optional twist:  
The predators are **still nearby**, just dormant.

---

### Persistent Impact

- PCs are treated as dangerous if loud.
    
- Silence becomes a mechanical modifier in later encounters.
    
- Breaking the market’s trust affects regional reputation.
    

This teaches players that **customs exist for reasons**.

---

## Why These Four Work Together

They all share a theme:

> **Human systems became more dangerous than radiation.**

- Trade
    
- Medicine
    
- Time
    
- Social behavior
    

None require villains.  
All create _choices with consequences_.  
All reward observation over firepower.

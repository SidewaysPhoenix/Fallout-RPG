Near Diamond city is a sewer grate that looks like it was blocked off by a contruction crew.

Upon entering the sewer you are greeted by a grisly scene, a skeleton strung upside down on the wall by its feet with a white chalk x just below the skull. Next to it is a little cabinet with children's toys, one of which is building blocks that spell out "Hi" some chalk, and sitting on top is a holotape.
* Dear Detective 1

Travelling further into the tunnel you find the next macabre display.
This is now a dim area
A skeleton sitting above the drain grate on a ledge in a fishing pose and a toolbox behind it with chalk next to it. At the end of its line is a fish skeleton with a skull biting onto the fish. Between the skeletons spread legs you see 3 white chalk X's.

To venture further the players will need to get into the sewer water
In front of you is a dead ghoul that has not been looted. Traversing a little farther will 2 ghouls to try to initiate combat.

After dispersing the ghouls just to the right is another skeleton, this one clothed and next to a toolbox and radio, above it on the wall another white chalk x

Further in you follow breaks in the walls as it now becomes dark away from the main tunnel and rounding a corner you see another dead ghoul.

Just beyond this wall is another playing dead, roll a test to see if they spot it.

Right next to them is the next presentation this murderer has left
In the glow of a faint red light is a barbecue pit with a skull and the arm bones spread on the grill and a holotape on the tray table
* Dear Detective 2

Following the path you go down to a little pool of water upon entering the pool of water 5 bloatflys come swarming out of the overflow pipes. There are several radioactive barrels in here that will trigger at each combat turn.

They come to a fork in the path 
If they go left, at a dead end they will find another skeleton with a white chalk x above it and some food items in a shopping cart
If they go right they come across a well lit cavernous room with a walkway going over water, a broken wall above where you can see more tunnel.
On entering this room 6 ghouls will attack they will be hidden until the players fully enter toward the walkway.
1 directly from the left behind the players ,3 stalkers from the water, 2 from up above 

After combat the players will see several of the murderers victims, where the ghoul was hidden on the left is 4 skeletons with dresses all draped over baby carriages, along with baby bottles and toys on the ground. Above this scene is 4 white chalk x's on the wall.

Above just below the broken wall sitting on a grating outcropping is a skeleton with a bovine skull wearing a bowler hat and a human skull laying beside it, next to this is a white chalk x.

To the right is the path onward
In this next room is a wood pallet stage with manequins on their stands holding another skeleton, and a shelf beside it littered with skulls near this is another white chalk x on the wall. Opposite this scene is a single chair and side table. On this table is a holotape
* Dear Detective 3

Into the next room you see skeletons all around in shopping carts, on storeroom shelves and all over the floor with a wooden walkway going up deeper into the tunnel, at the end of this walkway sits a doghouse inside is another victim this one with a dog collar around its neck and its head in a food bowl, next to this is 3 [[Canned Dog Food]]. Above it on the dog house is a white chalk x.

Up the stairs from this is yet another victim arranged in a lawn chair sitting at an outdoor table with umbrella, a white chalk x nearby.

A little further in you come across a larger room with with stairs, machinery, and storage boxes.
Around you is mannequins all around as you investigate ghouls attack.This is a dark area
1 crawls out from the boxes under the stairs another from a room to the side and a glowing one from a room to the back right.

After combat there are several areas to check,
The side room- On a table sits, a [[Stealth Boy]], a rare book, and [[RadAway]], and a holotape
* Dear Detective 4
The back area- a steamer trunk with variable loot from loot tables
and another of his victims and chalk x
The back right - on a cabinet is another victim of his and the white chalk x. A hole in the wall leads to a small room with a operating table, lights, desk, barrel (radioactive).
On the desk is a flamer with flamer fuel.

Following the path out you see more of his victims laid out on a bed embracing one another 2 chalk x's above them, eventually the path takes you back to the main waterway where you drop down and make your way back to the surface.

###### TOXIC
**Requirements:** 

**Description:**  
The creature’s bite, sting, or claws are home to a particularly nasty venom, which often kills those who aren’t slain by the initial attack. 

**Effect:**  
The creature’s melee attacks gain the [[Persistent]] (Poison) damage effect. Further, choose one of the following damage effects: [[Fallout-RPG/Descriptions and Rules/Combat/Damage Effects/Radioactive|Radioactive]], [[Stun]], or [[Vicious]]. The persistent Poison damage is counted as having the chosen damage effect.

**Mutation:**  
When this creature mutates, it exudes toxic fumes as well. Anyone within Reach of the creature at the start of its turn suffers 5 D6 Poison damage. This Poison damage also has the damage effect chosen.

###### LEGENDARY DAMAGE
**Requirements:** 

**Description:**  
Sharp teeth, razor-edged claws, a swift blade, or a keen shot with a rifle. The creature or character is notable for the deadliness of its attacks. This could appear on any creature or character.

**Effect:**  
Select one of the creature’s attacks. That attack inflicts +3 D6 damage. If the attack is a ranged weapon with a Fire Rate of 1 or higher, then it may also use the Let Rip (or equivalent) ability once more per scene.

**Mutation:**  
When this creature mutates, its attacks become faster. When the creature uses the attack selected for the effect, above, and spends AP to make an extra major action, it only spends 1 AP rather than 2, and it does not suffer any increase in difficulty as long as the second major action is also an attack. In addition, if the chosen attack is a ranged weapon with a Fire Rate of 1 or higher, then it regains one use of Let Rip (or a similar ability).

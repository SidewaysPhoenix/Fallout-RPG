###### STALKER
**Requirements:** 

**Description:**  
The creature is wary and careful, only striking when it feels it has the edge, and often using stealth and darkness to cover its attacks. 

**Effect:**  
The creature gains one automatic success on all Sneak tests (or tests to hide or move silently), and its Initiative is increased by +2. While in shadow, darkness, or some form of concealment, its Defense is increased by +1. 

**Mutation:**  
When this creature mutates, it becomes invisible as if it had activated a [[Stealth Boy]] (**Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.171).

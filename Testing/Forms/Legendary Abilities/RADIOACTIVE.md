###### RADIOACTIVE
**Requirements:** 

**Description:**  
The creature’s body, blood, and everything else are heavily irradiated. This doesn’t seem to hinder the creature in any way, but it certainly has an effect on everything near them. This is most common on insects and animals (especially ones with the Glowing template), glowing ones, super mutants, and any robot with a nuclear power source. 

**Effect:**  
The creature is immune to Radiation damage if it wasn’t already. In addition, the creature’s melee attacks all gain the Radioactive damage effect.

**Mutation:**  
When this creature mutates, its damaged body leaks even more radiation. Any creature within Close range of the creature at the start of their turn suffers 5 D6 [[Piercing]] 1 Radiation damage.

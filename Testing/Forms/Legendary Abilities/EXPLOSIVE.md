###### EXPLOSIVE
**Requirements:** 

**Description:**  
Commonly encountered in legendary robots— machines that have dangerously strayed from their programming and begun to modify themselves in strange, haphazard ways. Whether mechanical or organic, the creature is extremely volatile and liable to detonate in spectacular fashion when slain.

**Effect:**  
This ability has no effect under normal circumstances.

**Mutation:**  
When this creature mutates, it enters a self-destructive state. All of the creature’s melee attacks gain the [[Fallout-RPG/Descriptions and Rules/Combat/Damage Effects/Radioactive]] damage effect. When the creature is reduced to 0 HP, it explodes, inflicting 12 D6 [[Fallout-RPG/Descriptions and Rules/Combat/Damage Effects/Radioactive]] Energy damage to everything within Close range. Any loot or items gained through salvage and butchery can still be recovered, but tests made to do so increase in difficulty by +2, as the remains are scattered over a wide area.

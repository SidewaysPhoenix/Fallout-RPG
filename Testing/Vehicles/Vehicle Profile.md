A vehicle has the following scores and values.

##### SPEED
A vehicle’s Speed shows how quickly it can move, measured in a number of zones. Also listed is the vehicle’s average overland speed in miles per hour.

##### SCALE
A vehicle’s Scale is a representation of its size. Scale 0 refers to any vehicle which is approximately the same size as a human. Scale 1 covers vehicles around twice the size of a human, and each additional increase in scale approximately doubles the size of the vehicle. On any test where the vehicles size or mass would be a problem, increase the difficulty by an amount equal to its Scale.

> Any vehicle with a Scale above 4 may take up multiple zones and may have their internal space divided into several zones. For example, the Prydwen has different cabins and decks, and exists across several zones on the environment map (the fore, the aft, etc.). The specifics of this are left to the GM’s discretion. 

##### PASSENGERS
The passenger entry shows how many passenger spaces are inside the vehicle.

##### QUALITIES
Vehicles come in a range of different types, from nimble motorcycles to rugged trucks, and everywhere in between. A vehicle’s qualities describe how it navigates the terrain around it, and how characters use it. Vehicles always have at least one quality, and a vehicle’s type is a trait that influences the difficulty of skill tests. 

A vehicle can only move across terrain allowed by its qualities: e.g., a wheeled vehicle like a car attempting to drive across a lake will just sink.

##### WEAPONS
The weapons entry on a vehicle lists the weapons it has mounted or incorporated into its design.

##### PHYSICAL DR/ ENERGY DR
The vehicle’s Physical DR or Energy DR is subtracted from damage inflicted on the vehicle by physical attacks or energy attacks, respectively.

##### COVER
The vehicle's Cover indicates how much cover resistance it grants its passengers if they are exposed. You cannot target passengers enclosed inside a vehicle.

##### IMPACT
A vehicle’s Impact is a damage rating in challenge dice ( d6 ), measuring its weight and the force with its ramming attack. This always inflicts Physical damage.

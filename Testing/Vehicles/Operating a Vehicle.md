When you’re inside a vehicle, you’re referred to as a **passenger**. Some passengers take on specific roles within the vehicle, referred to as **crew**. 

##### CREW ROLES 
Each character inside a vehicle can take a specific crew role related to that vehicle. Assuming a role requires a minor action to move into that position. 
* **Pilot:** A vehicle can have only a single pilot. The pilot takes actions to move the vehicle (see [[Vehicular Movement]]). Whenever the vehicle needs to make a skill test related to movement, the pilot will make the test generally using **AGI + Pilot**. A vehicle without a pilot automatically fails all tests. 
* **Gunner:** A gunner operates weaponry mounted on the vehicle (see [[Vehicular Attacks]], p.129). For a vehicle with multiple weapons, a gunner can only operate one weapon each turn, and any single weapon may only be operated by one gunner each round. 
* If a vehicle includes other equipment or functions beyond moving and attacking, for example radio operator or bombardier, other passengers may operate that equipment as a separate crew role.

> [!tip] Splitting Focus
> A single character can attempt to simultaneously assume the roles of both gunner and pilot, but their attack rolls and tests to pilot the vehicle are both made at +1 difficulty unless it has the Single-Seat quality.

> [!tip] PASSENGERS AND CARGO
> A vehicle can carry a number of passengers, including the crew, as noted in its entry. This represents the number of dedicated spaces for passengers in or on the vehicle—in many cases, the number of seats the vehicle has. 
> 
> Unlike characters, a vehicle cannot naturally carry extra items based on its STR or Scale, as a vehicle needs places to stow those items in order to carry them effectively. Additional cargo space is covered by the Cargo X quality. 
> 
> Items can be stored in passenger spaces instead of passengers—each passenger space can carry up to 200lbs of items in this way. Similarly, passengers can ride along in cargo space, with each passenger taking up the space of 200lbs of items. Passengers in cargo space are liable to have an uncomfortable or unsafe journey in their improvised space, suffering an additional +2 D6 damage from any impacts the vehicle suffers.

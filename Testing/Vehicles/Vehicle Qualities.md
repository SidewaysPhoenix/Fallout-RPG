In addition, this vehicle ignores any increases to Fuel Usage caused by traveling over Difficult terrain.

###### Cargo X: 
The vehicle may carry up to X lbs of additional cargo. 

###### Cumbersome: 
The vehicle is bulky and unresponsive. Increase the difficulty of movement-based tests for this vehicle by +1.

###### Enclosed: 
The vehicle is completely enclosed, protecting crew and passengers within. Crew and passengers cannot be targeted by attacks from outside the vehicle but also cannot use their own weaponry to attack external targets. Passengers and crew inside Enclosed vehicles do not suffer radiation damage from environmental effects.

###### Nuclear Powered: 
This vehicle has been fitted with a Nuclear Engine, which accepts Fusion Cores instead of other fuel types. When a [[Fusion Core]] is fitted, this vehicle’s Fuel Track gains an amount of Fuel equal to the number of charges in the [[Fusion Core]] (This is the vehicle's Maximum Fuel). In addition, if this vehicle has 0HP and suffers an Engine Injury, it begins to **Meltdown**. Roll a d6 at the beginning of the next Round and each Round thereafter. If an effect is rolled, the vehicle explodes, dealing 10 d6 (plus additional d6 equal to the vehicle’s Scale) [[Breaking]], [[Radioactive]], [[Vicious]] damage to everything within Close range.

###### Rugged: 
Operate tests to repair Rugged vehicles are reduced by difficulty by 1. 

###### Single-Seat: 
A single-seat vehicle is designed to be operated by a single pilot. The pilot can also assume the role of a gunner without the normal penalty.  
###### Watercraft: 
The vehicle travels only on water and cannot travel along the ground at all. If this vehicle suffers a Chassis critical hit, it begins to take on water, and will sink after a number of rounds equal to twice the vehicle’s Scale.

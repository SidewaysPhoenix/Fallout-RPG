### Vehicular Movement
The following movement actions are available to the pilot role. These movement actions are distinct from the movement actions the character can attempt, but, like a character, a vehicle may only take a single movement action each turn. 
* **Maneuver (Minor):** The vehicle moves to anywhere within close range. 
* **Careful Piloting (Major):** The vehicle moves a number of zones equal to half its speed, rounding up. If required to make a terrain test, reduce the difficulty of that test by 1.
* **Hasty Piloting (Major):** The vehicle moves a number of zones equal to its speed. All tests made by crew or passengers are made at +1 difficulty until the start of the pilot’s next turn. 
* **Defensive Piloting (Major):** The vehicle moves a number of zones equal to its speed -1. The pilot then makes an **AGI + Pilot** test with a difficulty equal to the vehicle’s size; if it succeeds, the vehicle’s Defense increases by +1.
* **Focused Driving (Major):** Make an **AGI + Pilot** test, with a Difficulty of 1. On a success, the vehicle moves a number of zones equal to its speed plus an additional zone for each AP spent. All tests made by crew or passengers are made at +1 difficulty until the start of the pilot’s next turn.

### Vehicular Zones
Vehicles move in combat zones like any other combatant in an action scene, from Reach to Extreme range. Vehicles, however, do not maneuver like characters do and some zone effects may affect different Vehicle types differently: 
* The terrain only affects vehicles of a specific scale or higher, like terrain that can easily be navigated by smaller vehicles. 
* The terrain only affects vehicles of a specific scale or lower, like obstacles that large vehicles can just power through or over unhindered.
* The terrain only affects vehicles with a specific quality, such as wheeled vehicles. 
* The terrain has a difficulty of 1, and thus can be ignored by those moving slowly and carefully, such as tight street corners.

##### Vehicle Terrain Test
Pilots make terrain tests using **AGI + Pilot**. If the terrain would be more difficult for larger vehicles, the gamemaster may increase the difficulty, complication range, or both by an amount equal to the vehicle’s scale.

> [!tip] Out of Control
> It’s a constant fear for a pilot to lose control of their vehicle, they can cause a lot of damage and injure a lot of people in the process. 
> 
> The most common outcomes of a failed vehicle terrain test are below, and the GM determines which applies in each case. Some of the results below cause the vehicle to stop, which means the vehicle immediately loses any remaining movement it had from that action, and it comes to a halt in that zone. 
> * **Jarring Stop:** The vehicle comes to an immediate halt, losing the rest of its movement from that action. Each character in the vehicle immediately suffers 3 d6 [[Stun]] Physical damage. 
> * **Skid:** The vehicles moves in a random direction (roll a d6: 1-2 the vehicle skids left, 3-4 the vehicle skids forward, 5-6 the vehicle skids right based on the vehicle’s direction of travel). If the vehicle collides with an object that would make it stop, inflict 1 d6 [[Piercing]] 1 Physical damage, +1 d6 for each zone the vehicle moved. 
> * **Spin:** The vehicle loses the rest of its movement from the action, and it is turned to face a different direction. The next vehicle movement action increases in difficulty by +1, or it needs a test if it didn’t before. 
> * **Stuck:** The vehicle loses the rest of its movement from the action, and it is held in place by the terrain. While this trait persists, the vehicle moves one fewer zone than normal with any pilot action, and it cannot move as a free action. 
> * **Plummet:** The vehicle, if an aircraft, descends in a rapid and uncontrolled manner towards the ground. The aircraft moves one zone forwards and three zones down, and crashes if it reaches a ground-level zone before then. If the aircraft crashes, it suffers 4 d6 [[Piercing]] 2 Physical damage, +2 d6 for each zone it moved before crashing. All passengers on board suffer this damage as well. 
> 
> If the pilot performed an action to move the vehicle during the previous round, and it was not stopped (either by the pilot, or by crashing) then the pilot must make another vehicle movement action or the vehicle goes **out of control**.

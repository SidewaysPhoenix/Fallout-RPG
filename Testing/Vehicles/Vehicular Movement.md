### Vehicular Movement
A character filling the pilot role is able to make the following movement actions for the vehicle they are piloting. These movement actions are distinct from the movement actions the character can attempt, but, like a character, a vehicle may only take a single movement action each turn.
* **Maneuver (Minor):** The vehicle moves to anywhere within close range. 
* **Careful Piloting (Major):** The vehicle moves a number of zones equal to half its speed, rounding up. If required to make a terrain test, reduce the difficulty of that test by 1.
* **Hasty Piloting (Major):** The vehicle moves a number of zones equal to its speed. All tests made by crew or passengers are made at +1 difficulty until the start of the pilot’s next turn.  ^379723
* **Defensive Piloting (Major):** The vehicle moves a number of zones equal to its speed -1. The pilot then makes an **AGI + Pilot** test with a difficulty equal to the vehicle’s size; if it succeeds, the vehicle’s Defense increases by +1.
* **Focused Driving (Major):** Make an **AGI + Pilot** test, with a Difficulty of 1. On a success, the vehicle moves a number of zones equal to its speed plus an additional zone for each AP spent. All tests made by crew or passengers are made at +1 difficulty until the start of the pilot’s next turn.

### Vehicular Zones
Vehicles move in combat zones like any other combatant in an action scene, from Reach to Extreme range. Vehicles, however, do not maneuver like characters do and some zone effects may affect different Vehicle types differently: 
* Some terrain types only affect vehicles of a specific scale. For example, a narrow pass may only block vehicles of Large Scale or larger, allowing Small vehicles to pass through with ease. 
* Some terrain types only affect vehicles with a specific quality, such as Watercraft vehicles.
* Some obstacles can be easily avoided with careful piloting, such as a narrow street or tight corner, meaning a Careful Piloting test can be used to avoid the issue entirely.

Pilots make terrain tests using **AGI + Pilot**. If the terrain would be more difficult for larger vehicles, the gamemaster may increase the difficulty, complication range, or both by an amount equal to the vehicle’s scale.

> [!tip] Out of Control
> It’s a constant fear for a pilot to lose control of their vehicle, they can cause a lot of damage and injure a lot of people in the process. 
> 
> The most common outcomes of a failed vehicle terrain test are below, and the GM determines which applies in each case. Some of the results below cause the vehicle to stop, which means the vehicle immediately loses any remaining movement it had from that action, and it comes to a halt in its current zone. 
> * **Jarring Stop:** The vehicle comes to an immediate halt, losing the rest of its movement from that action. Each character in the vehicle immediately suffers 3 d6 [[Stun]] Physical damage. 
> * **Skid:** The vehicles moves in a random direction (roll a d6: 1-2 the vehicle skids left, 3-4 the vehicle skids forward, 5-6 the vehicle skids right based on the vehicle’s direction of travel). If the vehicle collides with an object that would make it stop, inflict 1 d6 [[Piercing]] 1 Physical damage, +1 d6 for each zone the vehicle moved. 
> * **Spin:** The vehicle loses the rest of its movement from the action, and it is turned to face a different direction. The next vehicle movement action increases in difficulty by +1, or it needs a test if it didn’t before. 
> * **Stuck:** The vehicle loses the rest of its movement from the action, and it is held in place by the terrain. The vehicle cannot move out of the zone until either the obstruction holding it is removed or the pilot succeeds on a difficulty 2 **AGL + Pilot** test.
> * **Plummet:** This can only happen to aircraft. The aircraft descends in a rapid and uncontrolled manner towards the ground. The aircraft moves one zone forward and three zones down. If it reaches a ground-level zone during this movement, it crashes. If the aircraft crashes, it suffers 4 d6 [[Piercing]] 2 Physical damage, +2 d6 for each zone it moved before crashing. All passengers on board suffer this damage as well.

### VEHICULAR ATTACKS
Vehicle’s gunners can make attacks with mounted weapons in the same way as a personal weapon, using whatever skill applies to the weapon (typically **AGI + Small Guns, PER + Energy Weapons, or END + Big Guns**). You cannot carry these weapons normally or fire them without being mounted on a stand or vehicle first. All weapons mounted upon a vehicle are treated as if wielded in two hands, and ignore the [[Recoil]] (X) quality. 

If the vehicle has the exposed quality, then passengers may make attacks with their own weapons normally. 

When an attack is made against a vehicle, it is always considered to be Defense 1 if it is moving, or Defense 0 while stationary.

> [!tip] Attacking Passengers
> When you make a successful attack against a vehicle with the [[Vehicle Qualities#Exposed|Exposed]] quality, you can spend 2 AP to hit an exposed passenger instead. 
> 
> Attacks with the [[Blast]] quality, against exposed passengers, will hit both the vehicle and passengers. Attacks with the [[Arc]] or [[Burst]] damage effects (or similar abilities which may hit additional targets) which target an exposed vehicle can treat the passengers as additional targets.

##### RAMMING
The pilot of a vehicle that moves during its turn can attempt a melee attack against a target within reach, using the pilot’s **END + Pilot**, with a difficulty of 1. If the attack is successful, it deals the vehicle’s Impact rating as damage. When a vehicle rams another vehicle or building, the attacking vehicle suffers half the impact rating, rounding up, in Physical damage.

##### VEHICLE HEALTH POINTS AND INJURIES
Vehicles can be targeted for an attack like any other combatant, and loses HP just as a character or creature would. Vehicles have Physical damage resistance and Energy damage resistance just as characters and creatures do, but just like robots they are immune to Radiation damage and Poison damage. When attacking a vehicle, roll on the vehicle’s Hit Location table, included in the vehicle’s stat block, to determine where you hit. You may target a specific location, just as with a character or creature. A vehicle reduced to 0 HP suffers a critical hit and also stops working, going out of control if it moved in the previous turn. 

When a vehicle suffers damage from an attack, add its scale to the amount of damage needed to inflict a critical hit; for a scale 1 vehicle, it takes 6+ damage from a single attack to inflict a critical hit, instead of the normal 5+ damage. Vehicles, as objects, do not suffer fatigue from hunger, thirst, or lack of sleep. However, they have a fuel track, which functions identically to a character’s Thirst track, and requires fuel (gasoline or alcohol). 

A vehicle stops working when it reaches 0 HP. At this point, the vehicle can no longer be used. Vehicles can be repaired in the same way as robots. If a vehicle has been reduced to 0 HP and has more injuries than its Scale, then the vehicle is destroyed, and cannot be repaired. At best, it can be stripped for parts and materials. If one of those injuries was to the Engine, then the vehicle will explode at the end of the next round, inflicting 6 d6 [[Radioactive]] Energy damage to everyone within Close range as the vehicle’s power supply detonates. 

Critical hits suffered by a vehicle vary based on the location hit. Each critical hit may only be suffered once to each location. 
* **Chassis** Critical Hits weaken the structure of the vehicle. Add +2 d6 to the damage of attacks against a vehicle after it has suffered a Chassis critical hit. 
* **Engine** critical hits result in a fire. The vehicle suffers 3 d6 Energy damage at the end of each subsequent turn, ignoring its damage resistance. For each effect rolled, the damage also affects a single random passenger.
* **Weapon** critical hits disable weapon systems mounted on the vehicle. A vehicle critical hit prevents the weapon hit from being used.
* **Wheel** critical hits make the vehicle harder to control. Pilot tests to operate the vehicle increase in difficulty by +1, and the vehicle’s Speed is reduced by 1. The same applies to Wing and Rudder criticals.

> [!tip] Bumps and Bruises
> Whenever a vehicle is damaged, it’s possible the passengers will be hurt as well. Whenever a vehicle suffers one or more Critical Hits, each passenger suffers 4 d6 [[Stun]] Physical damage. 
> 
> If a vehicle is reduced to 0 HP, each passenger suffers 8 d6 [[Stun]] Physical damage. 
> 
> Passengers riding in a cargo space add +2 d6 to these damage values.

| Target Passenger | 2    | After a successful attack, you can target a passenger inside of an exposed vehicle instead of the vehicle.                                    |

### VEHICULAR ATTACKS
Vehicles can be targeted for an attack like any other combatant and lose HP just as a character or creature would. Vehicles have Physical and Energy Damage Reduction, but like robots, they are immune to Radiation and Poison Damage. When a vehicle is attacked, roll on the vehicle’s Hit Location table, included in the vehicle’s stat block, to determine where it has been hit. Attackers may target a specific location on a vehicle, just as with a character or creature, by increasing the difficulty of the attack by 1. 

Crew operating in the gunner role may make attacks with mounted weapons in the same way as a per- sonal weapon, using whatever skill applies to the weapon (typically **AGI + Small Guns, PER + Energy Weapons, or END + Big Guns**). All weapons mounted upon a vehicle are treated as if wielded in two hands, and remove the [[Recoil]] (X) quality if they have it. 

If the vehicle has the [[Vehicle Qualities#Exposed|Exposed]] quality, then passengers may make attacks with their own weapons normally. When an attack is made against a vehicle, it is always considered to be Defense 1 if it is moving or Defense 0 while stationary. 

> [!tip] Attacking Passengers
> When a character or creature makes a successful attack against a vehicle with the [[Vehicle Qualities#Exposed|Exposed]] quality, they can spend 2 AP to hit an exposed passenger instead. 
> 
> Attacks with the [[Blast]] quality will hit both the vehicle and passengers if either is exposed. Attacks with the [[Arc]] or [[Burst]] damage effects (or similar abilities that may hit additional targets) that target an exposed vehicle can treat the passengers as additional targets.

##### RAMMING
The pilot of a vehicle that moves during its turn can attempt the **Ram** action against a target within Reach of the vehicle, a melee attack using the vehicle itself as a weapon. To do so, the pilot makes an **END + Pilot** test, with a difficulty of 1. If the attack is successful, it deals the vehicle’s Impact rating in physical damage. When a vehicle rams another vehicle or building, the attacking vehicle suffers half the impact rating, rounding up, in physical damage.

##### VEHICLE HP AND INJURIES
Vehicles, as objects, do not suffer fatigue from hunger, thirst, or lack of sleep. However, they have a Fuel Track and deal with HP and Critical Hits in a similar way to creatures or characters.

###### FUEL TRACK
Every vehicle has a Fuel Track, a rating between 1 and 5 that represents the vehicle’s available fuel. The Track is listed on the vehicle profile as Maximum Fuel, which notes the upper limit of that vehicle’s Fuel Track. Unlike HP, Fuel Tracks begin at 0 and must be increased by adding fuel to the vehicle; adding fuel increases the Track to a limit of its Maximum Fuel Value. Typically, 1 gallon of fuel (alcohol, petroleum, etc.) converts into a single point on the Fuel Track. A single bottle of hard liquor (such as a bottle of Whiskey) contains up to a liter of alcohol, requiring roughly 5 bottles to convert into a single point on the Fuel Track. The Fuel Track degrades with use, and in some cases, due to complications or damage. Follow the table below to determine rough Fuel Usage, but feel free to tailor it to your needs during your game. The Standard Use column indicates how many miles of travel a vehicle must undertake to degrade its Fuel Track by 1, whereas the High-Quality Use column indicates the same, but for vehicles with the [[Vehicle Qualities#High-Quality Engine|High-Quality Engine]] quality.

###### Fuel Usage Table

| VEHICLE SCALE | STANDARD USE | HIGH-QUALITY USE |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 0             | 40 Miles     | 48 Miles         |
| 1             | 35 Miles     | 42 Miles         |
| 2             | 30 Miles     | 36 Miles         |
| 3             | 25 Miles     | 30 Miles         |
| 4             | 20 Miles     | 24 Miles         |
| 5             | 15 Miles     | 18 Miles         |

This table does not cover all eventualities. Traveling across Difficult terrain in a vehicle can be taxing unless the vehicle possesses the [[Vehicle Qualities#All-Terrain|All-Terrain]] quality. If not, traveling reduces the Fuel Usage characteristic by 20%, rounding down where applicable. For example, if a character were to drive a Bus across Difficult Terrain during that time, it would degrade a step on the Fuel Track after 16 miles rather than 20. In addition to Difficult Terrain, other effects can cause a Fuel Track to degrade. Engine Injuries (pg.32) cause vehicles to leak fuel, degrading its Fuel Track at the start of each of its turns. Complications during combat or travel could represent burst or damaged fuel lines, a leaky engine, or other issues, all of which could reduce the Standard or High-Quality Usage Ratings of a vehicle by a set amount until repaired. 

When a vehicle’s Fuel Track is at 0, its Speed rating (below) is reduced to 0 until it is refueled.

##### VEHICLE HP
Like any creature or character, a Vehicle has HP, which operates exactly the same as the HP of any other object or creature. When a vehicle suffers damage, it reduces its HP by the appropriate amount (after accounting for resistances). When a vehicle is reduced to 0 HP, it suffers a Critical Hit and also stops working, going [[Vehicular Movement#^caa520|Out of Control]] (pg.30) if it had moved during its pilot’s last turn. At this point, the vehicle is rendered inoperable and can no longer be used. 

Vehicles can be repaired in the same way as robots. If a vehicle has been reduced to 0 HP and has more injuries than its size, then the vehicle is destroyed and cannot be repaired. At best, it can be stripped for parts and materials.

##### VEHICLE CRITICAL HITS
Vehicles are more resilient to Critical Hits. When suffering damage, a vehicle adds its Scale to the amount of damage required to have a Critical Hit inflicted. For example, a Scale 1 vehicle would need to suffer 6+ damage in a single attack to suffer a Critical Hit rather than 5. 

Injuries suffered by a vehicle from Critical Hits vary based on the hit locations. Each Injury can only be suffered once but remains until it is repaired. Every vehicle has a profile, which is broken down into the following scores and values: SPEED A vehicle’s Speed shows the maximum number of zones it can move in one turn (when using the Hasty Piloting action). It also includes the vehicle’s average overland Speed in miles per hour. 

* **Chassis** Injuries weaken the structure of the vehicle. Attacks against a vehicle with a Chassis Injury deal +2 d6 additional damage.
* **Engine** Injuries result in leaking fuel and potentially catastrophic fires. At the beginning of each of its Turns, a vehicle with an Engine Injury degrades its Fuel Track by 1. In addition, if a vehicle is reduced to 0HP and has suffered an Engine Injury, roll d6. If an effect is rolled, the vehicle explodes, inflicting 6 d6 Energy damage to everyone within Close range.
* **Weapon** Injuries disable associated weapon systems mounted on the vehicle until repaired.
* **Wheel, Wing, and Rudder** Injuries make the vehicle harder to control. Pilot tests to operate the vehicle increase in difficulty by +1, and the vehicle’s Speed is reduced by 1.

> [!tip] Bumps and Bruises
> Whenever a vehicle is damaged, it’s possible the passengers will be hurt as well. Whenever a vehicle suffers one or more Injuries, roll a d6 for each passenger. On an effect, that character suffers 4 d6 [[Stun]] physical damage.

# Creature Templates

There are common traits and forms of creature that seem to transcend species. These common creature forms are represented here by Creature Templates, which can be added to any existing creature or character. 

The sidebar on ghoul characters (**Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.393) is a basic example of this kind of template. 

A creature may only have one template.
* * *
##### ALPHA

The creature, part of a pack or other group, is somewhat larger than the others, but is mainly distinguished by its dominance, taking the lead and having the others follow. 

**Requirements:** This template can only be applied to a creature. 

* **Level:** The creature is one level higher than normal. Make the following changes: 

	* Add +1 to the creature’s Body or Mind 

	* Add +1 to one of the creature’s skills 

	* Adjust Initiative in line with increased Body or Mind

	*  Add +1 HP, or +2 if Body was increased. 
	 
	*  Add either +1 to one type of damage resistance on all locations, or +1 D6 to one attack.
	
*  **Special Abilities:** The creature gains the Aggressive and the Leader of the Pack abilities:

**Aggressive:** The creature is quick to action when it senses prey. When the creature enters a scene, immediately generate 1 Action Point. If the creature is an ally, then this goes into the group pool. If the creature is an enemy, then it goes into the GM’s pool. 

**Leader of the Pack:** The creature leads a group of its kind. All Normal creatures of the same kind and lower level within Close range may re-roll 1d20 on all tests while this creature is still alive.

##### GLOWING

The creature has absorbed so much radiation and somehow survived that its body glows with an unearthly green light. Glowing ones—feral ghouls who have had this happen to them—are particularly infamous, as they heal other ghouls nearby, but they are far from the only kind of Glowing creature out in the Wasteland. 

**Requirements:** This template can only be applied to a creature that is not a robot. 

* **Special Abilities:** The creature gains the Glowing and Immune to Radiation abilities: 

**Glowing:** The creature inflicts 2 D6 Radiation damage to anyone within Reach of it at the start of each of its turns. In addition, any melee attacks it makes gain the Radioactive damage effect; if it already had this damage effect, it instead inflicts 2 Radiation damage per Effect rolled. 

**Immune to Radiation:** The creature reduces all Radiation damage suffered to 0, and cannot suffer any damage or effects from radiation.

##### RABID

The creature is diseased and driven mad by the sickness ravaging its body. The foaming spittle at its mouth is a clear sign, and its bite is a sure way to pick up some nasty infection. 

**Requirements:** This template can only be applied to a creature that is not a robot. 

* **Special Abilities:** The creature gains the Feral and Rabid abilities: 

**Feral:** The creature is unintelligent, driven purely by feral instinct. Feral creatures cannot be persuaded or influenced by Speech tests. Feral creatures move towards and attack the nearest enemy. If they cannot detect an enemy, they move towards the nearest source of bright light or loud noise. Failing that, they will move around randomly or simply lie down and do nothing. 

**Rabid:** The creature’s melee attacks gain the [[Persistent]] (Poison) damage effect. Further, when a creature suffers any Poison damage from a Rabid creature’s attacks, it counts as two exposures to disease for the purposes of seeing if you’ve contracted a disease (**Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.193).

##### SCORCHED

A scorched is created when a human, or other creature, comes in contact with a scorchbeast, as the mutated fungus-like plague called the Scorched Plague it carries mutates those infected. The skin goes through a rapid change, from a charred black to bloodred lesions, as if they had been flayed alive. Complete loss of hair and cataracts of the eyes also occurs, and green ultracite crystals begin to protrude randomly from the skin. As well as affecting the appearance, those infected also succumb to complete degeneration of their mental faculties. While a rudimentary hive mind seems to connect the Scorched, the only instinct left for those infected is violent aggression towards everything but other scorched. 

**Requirements:** This template can only be applied to a non-mutated human character or a non-robot creature.

* **Attributes:** A character’s CHA and INT are reduced to 1. A Scorched character has 0 Luck points. A creature’s Body and Mind scores are unchanged. 

* **Skills:** A character loses all ranks in skills except Athletics, Melee Weapons, Sneak, Survival, and Unarmed. The character must change their tag skills to one of the listed skills. Creatures’ skills are unchanged. 

* **Attacks:** Scorched are still able to wield melee weapons if they did so before, but they can no longer use weapons to make ranged attacks (they may still make ranged attacks natural to the creature). Attacks from a scorched character or creature count as exposure to a source of disease. 

* **Special Abilities:** The scorched character or creature gains the Scorched ability: 

**Scorched:** The creature is barely intelligent, driven by instinct and aggression against the uninfected. Scorched creatures cannot be persuaded or influenced by Speech tests. Scorched creatures move towards and attack the nearest enemy, and due to their hive mind, when one scorched becomes aware of prey, all others within Long range will be alerted and move to attack. If they cannot detect an enemy, they move towards the nearest source of bright light or loud noise. Failing that, they will move around randomly or simply stand perfectly still.

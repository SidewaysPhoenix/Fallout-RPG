name: "Enclave Tesla Soldier"
desc: "Wielding a heavy weapon and sporting more advanced armor, these soldiers can be found on the battlefield or as personal guards for high-ranking members. Having received additional training in heavy weapons, these troops outclass regular troopers, outputting massive damage and changing the shape of the fight. Not only does their advanced armor make them tougher, but it also complicates attacks against them, shocking anyone who would attempt to take them down in a hand-to-hand fight, making them a threat whether near or far."

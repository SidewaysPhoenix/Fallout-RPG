name: "Enclave Hellfire Trooper"
desc: "Some of the greatest fighters amongst the Enclave are nominated to become hellfire troopers. Donning a full set of Hellfire Power Armor and carrying their signature heavy flamers, these elite troops bathe the battlefield in flame. Aggressive and confident, they never back down from a fight, incinerating anything nearby till their last breath with unmatched tenacity. Having risen the ranks of the Enclave, these troops are looked up to with reverie and respect by their fellows on the battlefield, acting as examples of what a soldier should be. Their mere presence is sometimes enough to sway battles in the Enclave's favor, terrifying the enemy and inspiring their allies."

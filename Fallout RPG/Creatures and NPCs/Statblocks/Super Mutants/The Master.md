name: "The Master"
desc: "Before the Master there was Richard Grey, and before him Richard Moreau, an ex-Vault dweller with a shady past. As a resident scientist and doctor at the Hub, Grey was drawn into an ill-fated expedition to Mariposa Military Base, where he was immersed in a vat of Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV). Left for dead and in indescribable agony, Grey slowly mutated beyond all recognition. His new shambling form absorbed the forms and intellects of any creature, or computer, that got too close. Through trial and experimentation, he found that creatures exposed to the FEV exhibited increased, and delectable, intelligence. Thus began his experiments. First came the centaurs: created from dogs and rats; later came the super mutants: created from humans. Realizing he needed specimens untainted by the background FEV and radiation of the wasteland to create a new race perfectly adapted to the new world, he sent his ever-growing army of super mutants to hunt for “prime normals.” After exposing an untainted human to the FEV, he created another super-intellect which he subsequently assimilated. It was these debaucherous acts that truly created the Master hive mind."

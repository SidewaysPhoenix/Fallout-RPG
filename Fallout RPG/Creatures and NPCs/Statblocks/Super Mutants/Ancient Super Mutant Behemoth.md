desc: "Feared even by super mutant behemoths, an ancient super mutant behemoth is one of the deadliest creatures to roam the Wasteland. Having survived through a mixture of brute strength and animalistic cunning, these goliaths mutated far beyond any of their kin. They are the undisputed masters of wherever they chose to make their lair, whether surrounded by a gang of lowly super mutants in an old military base or out in the wilderness, they take what they like and only a fool would try to stop them."

When this creature mutates, its Gargantuan Club gains the [[Arc]] damage effect."

desc: "Descended from salamanders, these slick reptilians can be found anywhere swampy and dank, preferring to stay near water these creatures spend much of their time residing in trees. Hanging upside down by their tails to rest and recuperate or watch for prey. When on land, gulpers walk predominantly on two legs, though if speed is required, they can run on all fours, and easily outrun most humans."

 - name: "AMPHIBIOUS:"

 - name: "PATIENT PREDATOR:"

 - name: "MASSIVE STRENGTH:"
   desc: "The gulper’s strength is concentrated in its tails and neck, and it is capable of launching objects as large as a standard car."
 - name: "AGGRESSIVE:"
   desc: "Gulpers are quick to action when they sense prey. When a gulper enters a scene, immediately generate 1 Action Point. If the gulper is an ally, then this goes into the group pool. If it is an enemy, it goes into the GM’s pool."
 - name: "WEAK SPOT:"
   desc: "If an attacker chooses to target the gulper’s torso, it ignores the creature’s DR. This does not apply against hits which hit the head due to random chance."

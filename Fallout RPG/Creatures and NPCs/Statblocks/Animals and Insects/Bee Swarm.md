name: "Bee Swarm"
desc: "Unlike many creatures that now inhabit the wasteland, these creatures have widely avoided the effects of radiation. They live much like they did before the Great War, living in colonies formed around their queen, pollinating the local flora, and making honey. However, when the hive is disturbed, its inhabitants rush out in a swarm to protect it, stinging anything that endangers the hive."

   desc: "The bee swarm consists of many normal-sized bees that together make up its mass. The swarm is able to occupy the entire zone it is in and is considered to be within Reach of all characters and objects. This does not prevent there being multiple swarms within the same zone. The swarm takes double damage from attacks with the Blast quality, or with the [[Arc]], [[Burst]], or [[Spread]] damage effects."
 - name: "CLOUD OF STINGERS:"
   desc: "At the end of the bee swarm’s turn, creatures within the zone suffer 1 D6 Poison damage."
 - name: "AIRBORNE:"
   desc: "The bee swarm can move freely through the air, they ignore most ground-level obstacles and difficult terrain effects, and they can move through 'empty' zones above the battlefield."

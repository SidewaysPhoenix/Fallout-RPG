name: "Floater"
desc: "Named after their large flotation sacks, these creatures were the answer to a question posed by West Tek: what happens when a flatworm is exposed to the Forced Evolutionary Virus? The result was surprising, changing the soft-bodied invertebrate into an unrecognizable floating sack of bile and menace. After breaking confinement, they took their place in the wilderness, hunting prey by burrowing underground and luring them close by emitting a vibrant and colorful mist from their exposed tongue. This was until they were found by the super mutants, another victim of the FEV, who shared a particular bond with them. Though they can still be found in the wild, many have been tamed and now work alongside the super mutants and their mutant hounds."

 - name: "AMBUSH:"
   desc: "The Floater hides underground, its tongue protruding from the earth, emitting a bright cloud of color. A successful **INT + Survival** test with a difficulty of 2 reveals its location. If a character succeeds in this test, they and their allies are unaffected by its Shock Tactics ability."
 - name: "SHOCK TACTICS:"
   desc: "When the Floater bursts from its Ambush, all creatures within Close range who were unaware of the Floater must make an **END + Survival** test with a difficulty of 2. Until the end of its next turn, each creature that failed this test suffers +1 difficulty on attacks made against the Floater and its allies."
 - name: "FLOATING:"
   desc: "The Floater floats above the ground and is unaffected by difficult terrain or obstacles."
 - name: "COMBUST:"
   desc: "When the Floater is reduced to 0 HP, it clutches its head and lets out a shriek as its gas sack expands. It uses its major action to combust. This attack is centered upon itself and kills the Floater."
 - name: "MUTANT FRIEND:"
   desc: "Floaters are friendly to super mutants unless hurt by them. Super mutants gain one automatic success on any **CHA**-based test that involves taming or instructing this creature."
 - name: "ABNORMAL ANATOMY:"

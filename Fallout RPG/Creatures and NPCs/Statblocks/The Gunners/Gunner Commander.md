name: "Gunner Commander"
desc: "The Gunner’s mercenary nature means you’ll only ever find them where there is profit to be made, whether this is taking jobs for caps or stripping down pre-war ruins for tech and salvage. With well-maintained weapons and Power Armor, the Gunner Commanders embody the military ideal of the group. They excel at small squad tactics, fortifying and holding strategic locations. No matter the job, Gunner Commanders have the skills to get it done."

name: "Stalking Trapper"
desc: "These trappers carry powerful weapons and wield them with mixed proficiency. Some carry harpoon guns, colossal weapons once affixed to ships for hunting large fish. By modifying their cases, they allow them to be carried with two hands, and though this has led to some loss in strength, they are still devastating. Other trappers carry lever action rifles, accurate and reliable; they are the perfect weapon for a hunter."

desc: "Few in the Commonwealth are sturdy enough to make it past the punishing trials required to be a Forged member, but these raiders managed it. Whether these raiders joined upon hearing of the gang’s victory over the Gunners or were members from long before, they emerge sturdy and reliable. Whatever the circumstances or recruitment, they all live according to the tenants set out by Slag. Whether they believe them or not is irrelevant, as they know death is the only thing provided to nonbelievers."

- name: "LET RIP:"
  desc: "Once per combat, the Forged may ‘let rip’ with a volley from their [[Laser Gun]] or [[Flamer]]. This adds the weapon’s Fire Rate of 2 or 4 to the weapon’s damage for a single attack (for a total of 6 D6 for the [[Laser Gun]], or 7 D6 for the [[Flamer]]). The [[Flamer]] may additionally use the [[Burst]] quality ‘for free’ without spending additional ammunition."

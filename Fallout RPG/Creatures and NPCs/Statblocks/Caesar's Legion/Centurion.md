name: "Centurion"
desc: "In command of 80 legionaries, the centurions are fanatically loyal to Caesar, ensuring that they, and all their men, carry out Caesar’s commands or die trying. Centurions are easily identifiable by their armor and plumed helms, each adorned with trophies taken on the battlefield. It is not unusual to see centurions sporting Power Armor pieces or super mutant armor. The feat of defeating these foes hammered home by the fact that no legionary wears a Power Armor frame and must support these armor pieces with their strength alone."

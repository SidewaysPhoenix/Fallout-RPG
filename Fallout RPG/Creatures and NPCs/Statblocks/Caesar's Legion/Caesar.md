name: "Caesar"
desc: "Born Edward Sallow, a citizen of the New California Republic (NCR) and member of the Followers of the Apocalypse. Edward learned much about the pre-War world from his time in the libraries of the Followers. It wasn’t until after being captured by the Blackfoot tribe and seeing their primitive ways of making war that Edward realized the use of his knowledge. Unwilling to leave his companion, Joshua Graham, in the hands of these soon-to-be conquered savages, Edward taught them the ways of total war. Gaining victory with his tactics, the Blackfoots soon regarded him as their leader. Taking the name of 'Caesar' for himself, he reshaped the tribes under his command into his new Legion, modeled on the ancient Roman army. Following his namesake’s conquest of Gaul, he began his campaign to bring Pax Romana to the post-apocalyptic world. \n\n Absorbing any defeated tribe he deemed of worth, Caesar soon stood at the head of a vast nomadic army until he reached his Rubicon—the Colorado River. \n\n The Legion’s first foray across the Hoover Dam ended in defeat and retreat. Caesar’s second, Graham, now Malpais Legate, was set aflame and cast himself into the Grand Canyon for his failure. Caesar amassed his forces on the eastern side of Hoover Dam, planned to defeat the NCR, and hoped to establish his new empire with New Vegas as his New Rome."

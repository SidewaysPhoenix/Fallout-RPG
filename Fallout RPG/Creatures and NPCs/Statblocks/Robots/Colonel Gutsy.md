name: "Colonel Gutsy"
desc: "General Atomics International produced a stronger version of the Mister Gutsy model of robots designed for military use. Its Colonel ranking distinguishes it from the rest of the Mister Gutsy line, such as its military software and independent functionality. Like the rest of its line, this robot was rushed out of the door at General Atomics to fulfill their deadline to the army, leading Colonel Gutsy to fight with extreme prejudice against any unauthorized military personnel. This is not true for all Colonel Gutsy units; however, as their flagship military model, some were developed further and continue to serve their initial objectives during the Great War: roaming the wastes and looking for enemy combatants to gun down."

name: "Liberator"
desc: "Initially developed by the People’s Liberation Army, these small robots were deployed behind enemy lines as infiltration devices in swarms. Despite their initial premise, these robots became a joke amongst American soldiers due to their poor design and sloppy execution. That was until the Fujiniya Intelligence Base became involved and improved the design from within the U.S. itself. These new bots (designated Mark 0–V) sported a variety of improvements, from propaganda-disseminating speakers to upgraded weapons systems. These bots were now a force to be reckoned with and no longer accidentally self-destructed due to incorrectly determining its capture. The PLA quickly accepted this new design, but before the units could be rolled out, the Great War broke out, stifling any plans for deployment. If it weren’t for the Enclave seizing the covert Fujiniya Intelligence Base, it is likely wastelanders would never have seen these bots."

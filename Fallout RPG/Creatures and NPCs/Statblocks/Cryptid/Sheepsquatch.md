name: "Sheepsquatch"
desc: "Deep in the mountains of Appalachia, the sheepsquatch stalks along the wooded foothills and valleys of the region. Thought to be a mere myth by most, this creature is shrouded in mystery. Though its origins start long before the Great War, some believe the creature is still out there. Though there are many reported sightings of the creature, they rarely have any concrete evidence to back up their claims. Regardless of the horrifying stories, cryptid hunters are rarely ready to meet this creature face to face, a fate few have ever survived. However, one hunter did survive, though they swore never to speak of the experience. Hoping that others would not follow in their footsteps, they took their secret with them to the grave, though not before writing it down in their personal journal."

name: "Wise Mothman"
desc: "This purple-eyed visage appeared to its cult on October 22, 2077, sharing with Brother Charles a warning of floods to come tomorrow. The Cult took refuge from these floods in high places and mines, but the floods that came were not the type that were expected. These floods consisted of radioactive fallout, and only those in the mines survived unscathed. It is this visage that is worshiped by the Enlightened, and some have speculated it may be associated with the visitor."

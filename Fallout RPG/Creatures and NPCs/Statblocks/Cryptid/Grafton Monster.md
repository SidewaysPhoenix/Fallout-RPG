name: "Grafton Monster"
desc: "Huge and muscle-bound, these FEV-mutated creatures were once thought to be mythical. Originally thought to be peaceful creatures that roamed the state of West Virginia, these creatures became very real and violent due to West Tek interference. West Tek took the previously developed snallygaster strain and slightly modified it, rapidly increasing in size and producing a headless—but stable—creature. Its muscle mass shattered its containment unit, and it attempted to escape. Though it was eventually captured and sedated, its transport to a more secure facility was interrupted by the start of the Great War, allowing it to escape as the bombs fell."

special_abilities:
 - name: "BIG:"
   desc: "The Grafton Monster is bigger than most characters. The creature receives an additional +1 health point per Level, but its Defense is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1. Further, it only suffers a critical hit if an attack inflicts 7+ damage (after damage resistance) in a single hit, rather than the normal 5+."
 - name: "MASSIVE STRENGTH:"
   desc: "The Grafton Monster is capable of lifting and throwing objects as large as a standard car."
 - name: "DESTRUCTIVE:"
   desc: "The Grafton Monster is huge and muscle-bound, able to shatter wood and metal beneath its fists easily. When the Grafton Monster attacks an inanimate object or a defensive structure, the damage increases by +3 D6."
 - name: "AGGRESSIVE:"
   desc: "The Grafton Monster is quick to action when they sense prey. When the Grafton Monster enters a scene, immediately generate 1 Action Point. If the Grafton Monster is an ally, this goes into the group pool. If they are an enemy, it goes into the GM’s pool."
 - name: "BLOW HOLES:"
   desc: "The Grafton Monster’s head is buried beneath layers of muscle and flesh; a hit to the head location of the creature is considered to strike its blow holes instead."
 - name: "WEAK SPOT:"
   desc: "If an attacker chooses to target the Grafton Monster's blowholes, it ignores the creature’s DR. This does not apply against hits which hit the head due to random chance."

name: "Wendigo"
desc: "Long before the Great War, people told tales of the wendigo around fires and bedsides. A malevolent spirit of hunger and greed. A being that would turn those whose hearts were filled with greed into cannibalistic murderers. These were thought of as nothing but old wives’ tales at the time, something to scare the children in line or to light-heartedly explain awful goings on. But now, after the Great War, the wendigo no longer sounds quite far-fetched. Violent and hungry, these creatures roam the wastelands amongst packs of lower ghouls through a strange bond. Little is known of their origin, though some have been traced back to pre-war humans connected by only one thing: murder and cannibalism. Whether there is weight to the old tales or merely coincidence, it’s impossible to say, but regardless, they stand as a reminder to never get too greedy."

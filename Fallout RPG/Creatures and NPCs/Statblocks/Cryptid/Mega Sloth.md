name: "Mega Sloth"
desc: "These gentle giants are the descendants of sloths. Slow and calm, they spend their days eating leaves and hanging from trees sturdy enough to hold them. Their thick fur is an ecosystem all on its own, supporting an interesting variety of insects and plants. Chief amongst these are the mushrooms that sprout over its body, a fungus that has a symbiotic relationship with the sloths. It is rumored these creatures first arrived in the USA before the Great War as pets, though as war broke out they escaped before finally mutating into the creatures seen now. Despite their docile nature, they are powerful combatants able to fight head on with yao guai and come out victorious."

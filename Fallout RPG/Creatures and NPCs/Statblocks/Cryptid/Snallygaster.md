name: "Snallygaster"
desc: "The first stable creature mutated with the FEV, a strange cocktail of different attributes and animal genomes these creatures were described as disturbing by their original creators. Despite this, the snallygaster was hailed as a massive success, providing invaluable insight into the workings of the FEV and giving hope to the scientists who had yet only seen failure. Though plans were made to release this specimen into the wild after it reached maturity, the Great War expedited the plan when it escaped captivity from a now-abandoned facility."

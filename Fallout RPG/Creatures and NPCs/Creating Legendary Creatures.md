The Wastelands are full of dangerous creatures, but some are deadlier than most. These creatures often gain a reputation all their own, being given names by the locals and anyone lucky or capable enough to survive an encounter with them. Mercenaries and wanderers are often hired to hunt down and destroy these legendary beasts if they become a serious problem.

To create a Legendary creature from an existing **Normal creature**, make the following changes:

* **Level and Type:** Change the creature’s type from **Normal Creature** to **Legendary Creature**. Its level remains the same. Multiply the amount of XP the creature is worth by three.

* **Body and Mind:** Add +2 to both the creature’s Body and Mind scores. This may affect other scores, such as HP, Initiative, and attacks.

* **Health Points:** Multiply the creature’s HP by three.

* **Special Abilities:** The creature keeps all existing special abilities, but also gains a distinct Legendary ability, from the list on p.140.

* **Inventory:** The creature’s normal inventory remains unchanged. In addition, add a single Legendary Weapon (p.96) or piece of Legendary Armor (p.104). If the creature already carries weapons or armor, choose one of those items to become Legendary. Otherwise, roll a d20: on 1-10, roll on the Armor loot table (**Fallout: The** **Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.201), on 11-15, roll on the Weapons (Ranged) loot table (**Fallout:** **The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.204), and on 16-20, roll on the Weapons (Melee) loot table (**Fallout: The Roleplaying Game**, p.205). Then, determine a Legendary property for that item.

desc: "Scraped together from spare parts, this repurposed fire hose takes its name a little too literally. Trading size for range, this weapon is perfect for immolating foes close up, though its lack of causing makes it quite unsubtle for anyone with skin. \n\n> [!tip] **Special:**\n Flame Jets are integrated into the arms of robots and can’t be used as a handheld weapon."

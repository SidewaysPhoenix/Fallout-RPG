name: "Jim's Limb"
desc: "A simple and chunky limb replacement, the process of attaching one of Jim’s Limbs under ideal circumstances is a measured and careful one. Under less-than-ideal circumstances it becomes significantly more traumatic. Marketed as “The Veteran’s Choice!” it may not have been their first choice."
effects: "Any character with a replacement limb from Jim’s limbs reduces their **AGI** score by 2. In addition, they cannot use [[Two-Handed]] equipment, or take the sprint action, and the AP cost to cross difficult terrain or obstacles is increased by 1."

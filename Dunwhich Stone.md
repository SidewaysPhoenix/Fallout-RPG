Pros
**Whispered Guidance (Benefit):** Once per scene, you may reroll 1d20 on any test. You must keep the new result.

Cons
**Voices of the Stone** 
* When you roll a Complication on a test, the GM may **spend 1 AP** to force you to make an **immediate, unwise action** (attack the wrong target, walk toward danger, speak a secret aloud, etc.).

**Mark of the Dunwich**
- While carrying the fragment, enemies who detect you are **more aggressive** (attack priority) because the stone “marks” you as prey.
    
- NPCs (Brotherhood scribes, wastelanders, caravans) may also react with fear or hostility when they sense it.

**Corrupted Luck**
- While carrying the stone, your **Complications range increases by 1** (so they trigger on 19–20 instead of just 20).

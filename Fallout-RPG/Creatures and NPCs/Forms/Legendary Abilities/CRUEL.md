###### CRUEL
**Requirements:** 

**Description:**  
The creature is especially cruel and seems to thrive when spreading pain and terror. This is most common on more intelligent, carnivorous animals (mammals and lizards), as well as super mutants and humans.

**Effect:**  
The creature gains 1 Luck point (even if it normally does not have Luck points) each time it inflicts a critical hit.

**Mutation:**  
When this creature mutates, add the [[Vicious]] damage effect to all of its attacks. If any attack already has the [[Vicious]] damage effect, instead increase that attack’s damage by +2 D6.

name: "Cyberdog"
desc: "Cyberdogs, or cyber hounds, are mechanically and technologically modified dogs. Though rare, each cyberdog is a unique work of engineering, as its design must accommodate different breeds and biologies. These modifications transform the dog physically, making it faster, stronger, and smarter while retaining its personality—remaining a loyal companion and friend. Due to the extreme challenges of creating a cyberdog, only technologically advanced organizations like the Enclave or Big MT had the resources to achieve this feat. Fortunately, once created, a cyberdog lives almost indefinitely with the proper maintenance and upkeep. For as long as the majority of its body remains intact, it can be restored."

desc: "A familiar and well-known robot in both pre- and post-War America, the Mister Handy line of robots produced a series of multi-functional robots that were used from everything from domestic aid, factory automation, and militaryapplications. Originally built by General Atomics International who later then entered a partnership with RobCo Industries, the Mister Handy line developed to also produce Miss Nanny and Mister Gutsy. All models of Mister Handy feature a nuclear power unit and a jet thruster which allows them to hover. They also all feature sophisticated programming, which allows them to mimic, understand, and learn human behavior. Several limiters within its system prevent them fromdeviating from their programming, but in units where these limiters are removed or damaged, it is not unusual to see Mister Handys developing their own independent personalities and a level of intelligence above their original design."

	Miss Nanny
After the popularity of the Mister Handy in the home, the 
Miss Nanny model was launched. This model was designed 
specifically to care for newborns and children and had 
several modifications to its programming to reflect this. The 
Miss Nanny model featured a friendly female voice and 
was equipped with subroutines for the discipline of unruly 
children, increased hazard detection, and sound analysis 
to understand the needs of children too young to talk. This 
model of the Mister Handy line of robots could also be modified for use in the medical field. 
Mister Handy and Miss Nanny are interchangeable robots 
with the same stat block and be used for each. If you would 
like to create a version of Miss Nanny for the medical field, 
make the following changes: 
 Reduce Repair by 1 and increase Medicine by 1.
 Un-tag Speech, and tag Medicine instead.

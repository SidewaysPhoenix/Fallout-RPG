name: "Augustus Autumn"
desc: "Augustus Autumn is the commanding officer of the Capital Wasteland Enclave, a position handed down to him by his father. A smaller contingent of the Enclave, consisting of older high-ranking officials, has become separated from the organization as a whole. He alone knows the secrets behind President Eden and, unlike his father, distrusts the ZAX AI unit. Despite this distrust, he still works alongside them, commanding the rank-and-file soldiers of the Enclave, being the sole communication between Eden and the troops and scientists. Under his command, the Enclave restarted secret programs to develop weapons and technology, including the impressive hellfire armor. Despite his station, Augustus is a relatively moderate individual fighting towards his own ideas of freedom and progress for the American people, standing in contrast with the Enclave’s plans to eradicate all mutant life. His organization’s members respect him and follow his orders with trust and conviction, believing themselves to be the last of the Enclave."

- name: "SHARP:"
  desc: "Once per scene, Augustus Autumn generates an automatic critical success on any **INT** or **CHA** skill test."
- name: "TYRANT:"
  desc: "More severe than a boss, chief, or alpha, Augustus utterly dominates others of its kind nearby. Augustus is typically accompanied by one or more Human Enclave members. There is one extra creature if it is the same level as Augustus, two extra creatures if they are one or two levels lower, or three extra creatures if they are three or more levels lower. When Augustus is reduced to half of his maximum HP, this ability mutates, and additional creatures arrive as reinforcements; the type and number of reinforcements is the same as the number of extra creatures noted above."

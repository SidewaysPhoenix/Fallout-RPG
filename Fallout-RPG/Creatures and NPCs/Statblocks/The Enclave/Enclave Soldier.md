name: "Enclave Soldier"
desc: "These individuals make up the majority of the Enclave’s forces, well-trained and provided for, they are the foundation of the strongest fighting force in the Wasteland. Having made their way through Enclave training, these soldiers are provided with power armor, laser weaponry, and a command to protect the Enclave with their life. Unlike many forces found in the Wastelands, they are regimented and structured, following a clear hierarchy of command from trainees to officers. Enclave soldiers are trained in advanced tactics and cooperation, working solidly as a team or as powerful independent infantry."

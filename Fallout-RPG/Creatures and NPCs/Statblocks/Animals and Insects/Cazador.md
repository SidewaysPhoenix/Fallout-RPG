 - name: "FLYING:"
   desc: " The cazador can move freely through the air. It can ignore most ground-level obstacles and difficult terrain effects, and it can move through “empty” zones above the battlefield if desired. It must spend at least one minor action each turn moving, and if it is knocked prone it falls to the ground, suffering 3 D6 [[Stun]] Physical damage, +2 D6 for each zone above ground level it was before it fell."

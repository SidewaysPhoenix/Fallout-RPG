name: "Giant Mantis"
desc: "First originating in Vault 22, this mutated insect has developed in harmony with the deadly Beauveria mordicana fungus. Introduced as pest control in a Green Vault experiment, these insects showed initial promise, killing off pests less vulnerable to the killer fungus and self-regulating their own population when prey was in short supply. \n\n However, once the human inhabitants of the vault fell victim to the fungus the mantises took over. With humans no longer there to regulate them, they flourished and grew, becoming as large as the people that once looked over them. They now spend their time hunting, lying in ambush to eat anyone who would come near the now abandoned vault, or dragging their victims within to feed them to the fungus. "

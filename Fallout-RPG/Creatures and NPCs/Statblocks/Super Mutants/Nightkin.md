name: "Nightkin"
desc: "The Nightkin were the ultimate creation of the Master. The perfection of his experimentations: super mutants that retained, or in some cases increased, their intelligence while being as strong as their less intelligent counterparts. Once serving as elites within the Master’s army, these super mutants can be found wandering the Wasteland, alone or in groups, searching for Stealth Boys to settle their addiction. This addiction has led to permanent blue-gray discoloration of their skin and chemical-neurological changes in their brains."

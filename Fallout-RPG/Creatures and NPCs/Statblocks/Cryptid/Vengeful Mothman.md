name: "Vengeful Mothman"
desc: "Mothman was reportedly not only sighted but summoned before the Great War. Presently, the Followers of the Winged One and the Cult of the Enlightened vie for authority on whether the red-or fuchsia-eyed visages are the true god. These two cults can be found scattered across Appalachia, but these mothmen are not the only ones you may encounter in the wild. Others include the orange-eyed mothman who stalks and flees if approached, and the ominous green luminescence of the scorched or glowing mothman. Whatever your beliefs, it’s clear that while there may once have been only one mothman, this species has spread across Appalachia and now appears to be far more than a singular entity.  \n\n This red-eyed mothman is aggressive and openly hos￾tile, sometimes appearing in three colorations: black, gray, or reddish bodies. Some sects of the Cult of the Mothman continue to worship these variants, though most are left to roam freely across Appalachia."

On rare occasions, a mothman may be infected by the Scorched Plague to become a scorched mothman or be exposed to enough radiation to become a glowing mothman. Should this happen, follow the instructions for applying Creature Templates on p.142 of this book.

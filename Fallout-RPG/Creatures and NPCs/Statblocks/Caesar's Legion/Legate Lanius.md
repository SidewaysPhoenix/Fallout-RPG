name: "Legate Lanius"
desc: "More myth than man, Legate Lanius is Caesar’s second in command and heir apparent after the fall of Joshua Graham, Malpais Legate. The stories surrounding Legate Lanius are many and varied, ranging from him having been raised a slave and working his way through the ranks to Legate on pure bloodlust and ferocity, to how he killed his tribe’s elders when they dared to surrender to Caesar rather than fight to the last. Whichever story you believe, there is no denying that he is a bloodthirsty and cruel leader who will stop at nothing to achieve victory. Lanius and Caesar weaponize Lanius’ life as a myth to achieve their goals."

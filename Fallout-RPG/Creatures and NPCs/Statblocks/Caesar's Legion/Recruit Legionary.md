- name: "FORGOTTEN TACTICS:"
  desc: "Caesar studied the ancient and forgotten arts of war and taught those he deems useful to his Legion. Once per combat, at the start of their turn, the legionary may spend 1 AP to attack with a Javelin as a minor action."
- name: "THE PRICE OF DISOBEDIENCE:"
  desc: "Even the lowliest recruit has been indoctrinated into the Legion. The only choice left to them: when and where they will die for Caesar. Unless no higher-ranking members of the Legion remain in a scene, the recruit legionary will not run and cannot be persuaded, as they know the price of disobedience."

name: "Scorched Wanderer"
desc: "Whoever they were before the Scorched Plague doesn’t matter. Their skin burned, and their mind rotted. The scorched wanderer is now no more than a puppet, molded and moved by the scorched hive mind. Sometimes their minds cling to an echo of who they once were, semi-lucid and aware but helpless against the scorched beast’s will. They fight anything not infected by the plague—before the days of immunity—would spread it far and wide. Of all the scorched, humans may be the most dangerous, for however much their minds degrade, many can still talk, shoot, and open doors."

 - name: "SCORCHED:"
   desc: "The scorched wanderer is barely intelligent, driven by instinct and aggression against the uninfected. Scorched creatures cannot be persuaded or influenced by Speech tests. Scorched creatures move towards and attack the nearest enemy, and due to their hive mind, when one Scorched becomes aware of prey, all Scorched within Long range will be alerted and move to attack. If they cannot detect an enemy, they move towards the nearest source of bright light or loud noise. Failing that, they will move around randomly or simply stand perfectly still and slowly petrify."
 - name: "PETRIFIED:"
   desc: "A scorched wanderer which is not moving is difficult to tell apart from a petrified corpse. It takes a **PER + Survival** test, difficulty 2, to spot a scorched wanderer which is currently not moving. Unlike ghouls, scorched do not use this ability to hunt and as soon as they become aware of anything moving nearby will move to investigate."

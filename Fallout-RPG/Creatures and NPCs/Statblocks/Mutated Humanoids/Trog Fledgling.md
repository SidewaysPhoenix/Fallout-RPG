name: "Trog Fledgling"
desc: "These younger trogs are smaller and weaker than those fully grown. Though their mind has long since departed, their body remains stronger than a normal human’s. Their constant exposure to the unique mix of radiation and industrial toxins in and around Pittsburgh will surely further their mutation in years to come. When alone, they are easily disposed of; however, when found in larger groups, they can overwhelm their prey with a wave of flesh and bile."

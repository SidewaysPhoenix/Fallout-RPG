name: "Trapper"
desc: "Constantly exposed to low-level radiation, a Trapper’s mind slowly dwindles, their thoughts addled by the now ever-present fog. Violent and aggressive, they now attack anything on sight, standing in stark contrast to their past, where slowly stalking animals for their rare coats was the norm. Though their armor is more suited to fighting beasts and birds, they carry powerful hunting rifles to ensure their target goes down quickly. Though they prefer their stalking clothes, some trappers opt for leather or simple metal armor for increased defense, sacrificing stealth for durability."

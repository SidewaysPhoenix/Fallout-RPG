Legendary creatures and Major characters created using the above method receive one of the following abilities as an additional special ability. You can also use these abilities in Legendary creatures/Major characters made from scratch. 

These abilities all function in two ways. First, they have a constant **Effect** that always applies. Second, they have a **Mutation**. A Legendary creature or Major character mutates the first time they are reduced to below half of their maximum HP, at which point they immediately take an extra turn (this is in addition to the creature or character’s normal turn) and gain the **Mutation** effect of their Legendary Ability for the remainder of the scene. 

If a creature mutates and then regains enough HP to go above half its maximum HP, the creature cannot mutate a second time.

##### CRUEL

The creature is especially cruel and seems to thrive when spreading pain and terror. This is most common on more intelligent, carnivorous animals (mammals and lizards), as well as super mutants and humans.

**Effect:** The creature gains 1 Luck point (even if it normally does not have Luck points) each time it inflicts a critical hit. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, add the [[Vicious]] damage effect to all of its attacks. If any attack already has the [[Vicious]] damage effect, instead increase that attack’s damage by +2 D6.

##### EXPLOSIVE

Commonly encountered in legendary robots— machines that have dangerously strayed from their programming and begun to modify themselves in strange, haphazard ways. Whether mechanical or organic, the creature is extremely volatile and liable to detonate in spectacular fashion when slain. 

**Effect:** This ability has no effect under normal circumstances. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, it enters a self-destructive state. All of the creature’s melee attacks gain the [[Fallout-RPG/Descriptions and Rules/Combat/Damage Effects/Radioactive]] damage effect. When the creature is reduced to 0 HP, it explodes, inflicting 12 D6 [[Fallout-RPG/Descriptions and Rules/Combat/Damage Effects/Radioactive]] Energy damage to everything within Close range. Any loot or items gained through salvage and butchery can still be recovered, but tests made to do so increase in difficulty by +2, as the remains are scattered over a wide area.

##### LEGENDARY DAMAGE

Sharp teeth, razor-edged claws, a swift blade, or a keen shot with a rifle. The creature or character is notable for the deadliness of its attacks. This could appear on any creature or character. 

**Effect:** Select one of the creature’s attacks. That attack inflicts +3 D6 damage. If the attack is a ranged weapon with a Fire Rate of 1 or higher, then it may also use the Let Rip (or equivalent) ability once more per scene. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, its attacks become faster. When the creature uses the attack selected for the effect, above, and spends AP to make an extra major action, it only spends 1 AP rather than 2, and it does not suffer any increase in difficulty as long as the second major action is also an attack. In addition, if the chosen attack is a ranged weapon with a Fire Rate of 1 or higher, then it regains one use of Let Rip (or a similar ability).

##### LEGENDARY PROFICIENCY

**Characters Only.** The character is notorious for their superlative skill in a specific field. 

**Effect:** Select one of the character’s Tag skills. Whenever the character attempts a test using that skill, they gain one automatic success, in addition to any rolled. 

**Mutation:** When this character mutates, they stop holding back. Tests using the chosen Tag skill now score two automatic successes rather than one.

##### RADIOACTIVE

The creature’s body, blood, and everything else are heavily irradiated. This doesn’t seem to hinder the creature in any way, but it certainly has an effect on everything near them. This is most common on insects and animals (especially ones with the Glowing template), glowing ones, super mutants, and any robot with a nuclear power source. 

**Effect:** The creature is immune to Radiation damage if it wasn’t already. In addition, the creature’s melee attacks all gain the Radioactive damage effect. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, its damaged body leaks even more radiation. Any creature within Close range of the creature at the start of their turn suffers 5 D6 [[Piercing]] 1 Radiation damage.

##### RAGE HEAL

The creature is driven by fury and adrenaline, and needs to be put down quickly or it will shake off any damage it suffers. 

**Effect:** The creature regains 3 HP at the start of each of its turns. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, it immediately heals back to its maximum HP.

##### SCARRED

The creature’s form is a mangled and twisted mass of scars, and it is extraordinarily tough to have survived such grievous injuries. 

**Effect:** The creature’s Physical DR and Energy DR are both increased by +2. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, roll 1 D6 for each Injury it has suffered. On an Effect, that Injury is removed. For the remainder of the scene, the creature’s Physical DR and Energy DR are increased by a further +2.

##### STALKER

The creature is wary and careful, only striking when it feels it has the edge, and often using stealth and darkness to cover its attacks. 

**Effect:** The creature gains one automatic success on all Sneak tests (or tests to hide or move silently), and its Initiative is increased by +2. While in shadow, darkness, or some form of concealment, its Defense is increased by +1. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, it becomes invisible as if it had activated a [[Stealth Boy]] (**Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.171).

##### TOXIC

The creature’s bite, sting, or claws are home to a particularly nasty venom, which often kills those who aren’t slain by the initial attack. 

**Effect:** The creature’s melee attacks gain the [[Persistent]] (Poison) damage effect. Further, choose one of the following damage effects: [[Fallout-RPG/Descriptions and Rules/Combat/Damage Effects/Radioactive]], [[Stun]], or [[Vicious]]. The persistent Poison damage is counted as having the chosen damage effect. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, it exudes toxic fumes as well. Anyone within Reach of the creature at the start of its turn suffers 5 D6 Poison damage. This Poison damage also has the damage effect chosen.

##### TYRANT

More severe than a boss, chief, or alpha, this creature utterly dominates others of its kind. 

**Effect:** The creature is accompanied by one or more Normal creatures of the same type. There is one extra creature if it is the same level as the Legendary Creature, two extra creatures if they are one or two levels lower, or three extra creatures if they are three or more levels lower. 

**Mutation:** When this creature mutates, additional creatures arrive as reinforcements; the type and number of reinforcements is the same as the number of extra creatures noted above.

# Traps
Aside from the potential hostile wildlife and people of the wasteland, danger can hide even in a seemingly abandoned area. Traps can be found in many locations across the wastes, from protecting settlements and homes, and defending supply caches, to being left as cruel tricks or deterrents.

> ## Modifiers to Difficulty Spotting Traps
A bunch of different circumstances can alter how difficult it is to spot a trap—if the mechanism is particularly camouflaged, the person setting the trap has put a lot of effort into hiding it, or they’ve altered the environment or lighting so it’s less visible. The following are examples of difficulty increases, depending on the circumstances.
> * **DARKNESS:** +1 to +2 difficulty for low light or almost blackout conditions. Pitch darkness renders characters unable to detect traps visually, unless they have some form of night vision like a weapon’s scope or they have a light source.
> * **CAMOFLAGE:** +1 difficulty for well-hidden or camouflaged traps. Certain mechanisms or triggers may blend in well to their surroundings, like mechanical traps within industrial machinery, or wooden traps amongst trees and foliage.
> * **HIDDEN:** +1 to +2 difficulty depending on how obscured the trap is from view. The trap may be hidden while the trigger is more visible, making detection only allow a character to know there is a tripwire or pressure plate in their way without knowing what it will set off. There can be a lot of junk out there in the wastes, and a lot hidden underneath it!

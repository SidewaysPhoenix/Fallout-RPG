| 5   | A sniper hidden in the ruins takes potshots at the party.                                        |
| 6   | A deathly silent street—until a pack of ghouls bursts from the sewers.                           |
| 7   | An abandoned campsite still has warm embers… someone is watching you.                            |

| 10  | A traveler asks for help with their broken-down car, but it’s bait for a trap.                   |
| 11  | A scavver waves you over—then their friends come from behind.                                    |
| 12  | A "safe house" found in the wasteland is rigged to explode when entered.                         |

| 14  | A strange radio signal leads you into an ambush zone.                                            |
| 15  | A chained-up Deathclaw is set loose as soon as you step too close.                               |
| 16  | The ground trembles as a hidden mirelurk nest erupts beneath your feet.                          |
| 17  | A "crashed" Vertibird is an elaborate Brotherhood of Steel training exercise—you're the targets. |
| 18  | A rusted-out bus has supplies inside… and a pack of Radscorpions waiting below.                  |
| 19  | A wounded survivor warns of danger ahead, but it’s a ploy to steal your gear.                    |
| 20  | A legendary raider lieutenant with a full gang waiting in the shadows.                           |

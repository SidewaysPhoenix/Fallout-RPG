In the Wasteland, reputation and power make a big difference when it comes to survival. A deadly rep can mean followers flock to your banner in hope of caps, loot, and plunder, while settlements may pay tribute rather than incur your wrath… but hired guns and would-be heroes could band together to bring you down. A good rep might see others seek you out for help or protection, but can in turn attract the anger of raiders and other warbands seeking plunder or a little less competition.

##### To create a Major character from an existing **Normal character**, make the following changes:

* **Level and Type:** Change the creature’s type from Normal Character to Major Character. Its level remains the same. Multiply the amount of XP the character is worth by three. Also, give the character a name: Major characters should be unique, noteworthy individuals. 

* **Attributes:** Increase the character’s S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes, adding +14 points, distributed as you see fit. The simplest approach is simply to add +2 to each attribute. These changes will affect the character’s other scores, such as skills and derived statistics. 

* **Luck Points:** A Major character has Luck points equal to their LCK. 

* **Skills:** The character receives two additional Tag Skills, each of which are rated at 2 initially. In addition, if the character’s INT increased, they will have additional skill points to spend. 

* **Derived Statistics:** Check if the character’s increased attributes would change any of their derived statistics. In addition, increase the character’s initiative by +4. 

* **Health Points:** Increase the character’s maximum HP by an amount equal to twice their LCK score. 

* **Special Abilities:** The character keeps all existing special abilities, but also gains either a distinct Legendary ability from the list on p.140, or two additional perks (p.59 of the **Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, or p.44 of this book).

* **Inventory:** The character’s normal inventory remains unchanged, but you may wish to add mods or better versions of the character’s weapons and armor. In addition, add a single Legendary Weapon (p.96) or piece of Legendary Armor (p.104). If the creature already carries weapons or armor, choose one of those items to become Legendary. You may wish to adjust the character’s attacks or damage resistances according to whatever Legendary item they’re carrying and using.

 * **Attributes:** Increase the character’s S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes, adding +7 points, distributed amongst each attribute as you see fit. The simplest approach is simply to add +1 to each attribute. These changes will affect the character’s other scores, such as skills and derived statistics.

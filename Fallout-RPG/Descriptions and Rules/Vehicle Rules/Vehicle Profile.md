Every vehicle has a profile, which is broken down into the following scores and values:

##### SPEED
A vehicle’s Speed shows the maximum number of zones it can move in one turn (when using the [[Vehicular Movement#^379723|Hasty Piloting]] action). It also includes the vehicle’s average overland Speed in miles per hour.

##### SCALE
A vehicle’s Scale is a representation of its size. Scale 0 refers to any vehicle which is approximately the same size as a human. Scale 1 covers vehicles around twice the size of a human, and each additional increase in Scale approximately doubles the size of the vehicle. On any skill test where the vehicle’s size or mass would be a problem, increase the difficulty by an amount equal to its Scale.
> [!tip] Large Vehicles 
> Any vehicle with a Scale above 4 may take up multiple zones and may have their internal space divided into several zones. For example, the Prydwen has different cabins and decks, and exists across several zones on the environment map (the fore, the aft, etc.). The specifics of this are left to the GM’s discretion. 

##### PHYSICAL DR/ ENERGY DR
The vehicle’s Physical DR or Energy DR reduces the amount of damage inflicted on the vehicle by matching damage sources.

##### COVER
The vehicle’s Cover rating indicates how much cover resistance it grants exposed passengers.

##### IMPACT
A vehicle’s Impact is a damage rating in challenge dice d6 that is used whenever the vehicle is used to perform the **Ram** action. This value is always noted as physical damage.

##### PASSENGERS
The passenger entry shows how many passenger spaces are inside the vehicle.

##### QUALITIES
Vehicles come in a range of different types, from nimble motorcycles to rugged trucks and everything in between. A vehicle’s qualities describe how it navigates the terrain around it and how characters use it. Vehicles always have at least one quality, and a vehicle’s type is a trait that influences the difficulty of skill tests.

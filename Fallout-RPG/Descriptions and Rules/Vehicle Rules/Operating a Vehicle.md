When inside a vehicle, characters are either **passengers** or **crew**. Passengers take no active role when in a vehicle, literally being only in it for the ride, while crew take active part in the operation of the vehicle, taking on a role while embarked.

##### CREW ROLES 
Characters inside a vehicle acting as crew will each have a role in its operation, with each crew member taking on one or more of those roles. Unless otherwise stated, not all roles must be filled for the vehicle to function properly. However, a crew member must be assigned to a role to perform the function of that role. For example, a Vertibird has both a Gunner and Pilot role. A crew member can operate the Gunner role without another crew member acting as a Pilot, but if this were the case, the Vertibird couldn’t move since that’s the pilot’s job.

* **Pilot:** Most vehicles can have only a single pilot. A pilot makes the actions necessary to move their vehicle (see [[Vehicular Movement]] below). Whenever the vehicle needs to make a skill test related to movement, the pilot will make the test, generally using **AGI + Pilot**. A vehicle without a pilot can’t move. If a vehicle is already moving and loses its pilot, it automatically fails all tests related to movement until the pilot role is filled.
* **Gunner:** A gunner operates weaponry mounted on the vehicle (see [[Vehicular Attacks]], p.30). For a vehicle with multiple weapons, a gunner can only operate one weapon each turn, and any single weapon may only be operated by one gunner each round. 
* **Additional Roles:** If a vehicle includes other equipment or functions beyond moving and attacking—for example, radio operator or bombardier— other passengers may operate that equipment as a separate crew role.

> [!tip] Splitting Focus
> A single character can attempt to simultaneously assume multiple roles as long as those roles can be feasibly operated at the same time. Should they do so, all tests made for each roll have their difficulty increased by 1. Vehicles with the [[Vehicle Qualities#Single-Seat|Single-Seat]] quality avoid this increase in difficulty.

> [!tip] PASSENGERS AND CARGO
> A vehicle can carry a number of passengers, including the crew, as noted in its entry. This represents the number of dedicated spaces for passengers in or on the vehicle—in many cases, the number of seats the vehicle has. 
> 
> Unlike characters, a vehicle cannot naturally carry extra items based on its STR or Scale, as a vehicle needs places to stow those items in order to carry them effectively. Additional cargo space is covered by the [[Vehicle Qualities#Cargo X|Cargo X]] quality. 
> 
> Items can be stored in passenger spaces instead of passengers—each passenger space can carry up to 200lbs of items in this way. Similarly, passengers can ride along in cargo space, with each passenger taking up the space of 200lbs of items. Passengers in cargo space are liable to have an uncomfortable or unsafe journey in their improvised space, suffering an additional +2 D6 damage from any impacts the vehicle suffers.

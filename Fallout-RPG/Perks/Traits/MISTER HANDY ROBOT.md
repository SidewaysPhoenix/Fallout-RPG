You have 360° vision and improved sensory systems that can detect smells, chemicals, and radiation, reducing the difficulty of Perception tests that rely on sight and smell by 1. You are also immune to radiation and poison damage, but you cannot use chems, nor can you benefit from food, drink, or rest. You move by jet propulsion, hovering above the ground, unaffected by difficult terrain or obstacles. Your carry weight is 150 lbs., and it cannot be increased by your Strength or perks, but it can be increased by modi- fied armor. You cannot recover from your own injuries or heal health points without receiving repairs (see Healing Robots, p.34). 

You cannot manipulate the physical world like humans do, instead you have three of the arm attachments in the Arm Attachments table, determined by your choice of equipment pack. If you select an arm that features a weapon, you also gain 20 shots of ammo for that weapon.

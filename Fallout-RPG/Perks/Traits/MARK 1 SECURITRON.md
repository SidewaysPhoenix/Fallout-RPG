**Ranks:** 1  

You are a robot, with the Mk I operating system designed by RobCo Industries. You have forward-facing visual sensors that can detect the visual spectrum. You are also immune to radiation and poison damage, but you cannot use chems, nor can you benefit from food, drink, or rest. You cannot recover your own injuries or heal health points without receiving repairs (see **Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.34). 

You move on a single tire, increasing the difficulty of skill tests to balance or remain upright by 1. Your arms are fitted with opposable claws, with which you can manipulate your environment rudimentarily and make unarmed melee attacks. The palms of your claws are outfitted with integrated weapons, as outlined in Choose Equipment, p.95. Your shoulders house missile launchers and a grenade launcher is integrated into the left arm, but they are both inoperable unless you are fitted with the Mk II operating system mod. Your carry weight is 150 lbs. It cannot be increased by your Strength or perks, but by modified armor.

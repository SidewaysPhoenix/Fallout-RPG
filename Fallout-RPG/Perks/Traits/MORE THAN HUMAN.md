**Ranks:** 1  

Though you appear mentally and physically human, your bioengineering makes you something entirely new and, in many ways, improved. You gain one additional tag skill. You cannot suffer from starvation or dehydration and do not need sleep, but you do not gain a benefit from consuming food or beverage items. When you rest, instead of sleeping, you may engage in minor activities such as crafting, reading, or light scouting. Additionally, you are immune to Poison and Radiation damage and disease. You do not age, nor do you gain or lose weight. 

When interacting with NPCs who know you are a synth—unless they are sympathetic towards synths—the difficulty of CHA tests made by you or your allies increases by 2. When a complication is rolled, they either become hostile, or your Faction Reputation or Settlement Reputation decreases by 1 per complication generated due to their fear of the Institute. 

The Institute has given you a unique recall code—an unalterable verbal command that resets your personality and memories. When you hear the code spoken, you become incapacitated until you are retrieved and restored by the Institute.

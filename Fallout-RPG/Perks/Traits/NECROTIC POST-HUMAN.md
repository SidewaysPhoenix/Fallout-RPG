You are immune to radiation damage. In fact, you’re healed by it—you regain 1 HP for every 3 points of radiation damage inflicted upon you, and if you rest in an irradiated location, you may re-roll your dice pool when checking if your injuries heal. In addition, Survival becomes a Tag skill, increasing it by 2 ranks. 

You age at a much-decreased rate, and you’re probably older than your unmutated companions—you may even have survived the Great War of 2077—but you’re sterile: “the first generation of ghouls is the last” as the saying goes. You may face discrimination from “smoothskins” (humans who aren’t ghouls), increasing the difficulty or complication range of Charisma tests depending on your opponent’s beliefs.

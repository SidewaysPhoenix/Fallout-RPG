Your unusual life experience grants you an extra perk at level one. Additionally, you were given a gift by Atom, unique even amongst other members of the Church. You can resist, store, and even channel radiation through your body. Though Atom has blessed you with his glow, you must be careful. Non-believers may not understand your gift and might be frightened when they witness it. 

Your base Radiation damage resistance is 1 and can be increased further by armor and perks. Once per scene, when someone in Close range to you would suffer Radiation damage, you can choose to take it instead. Whenever you suffer Radiation damage (minimum of 0), gain one **Radiation Point** up to a maximum of 5. When you hit with a melee attack, you may spend your stored Radiation Points—for every point you spend, deal an additional 2 D6 Radiation damage applied separately after inflicting the attack’s normal damage. When you sleep, you lose 1 Radiation Point.

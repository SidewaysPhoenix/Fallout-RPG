You are a robot, immune to disease, Radiation damage and Poison damage, but are unable to use chems or benefit from food, drink, or rest. You cannot recover from your injuries or regain health points without receiving repairs (see **Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, Healing Robots**, p.34). Your carry weight is 150 lbs., and cannot be increased by your Strength or perks, but it can be increased by modified armor. You move by bipedal motion and can manipulate your environment using your actuated three-fingered claw-like hands.

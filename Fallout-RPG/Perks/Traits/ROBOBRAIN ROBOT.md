You are a robot with a human brain as a central processor. You have visual sensors that can detect the visual spectrum and infrared, ignoring any difficulty increase to Perception tests in darkness. You are also immune to radiation and poison damage, but you cannot use chems, nor can you benefit from food, drink, or rest. You cannot recover your own injuries or heal health points without receiving repairs (see **Fallout: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook**, p.34). 

You move on two continuous tracks, and have two tube-like manipulators as arms with opposable claws you can use to control tools and objects designed for humans with precision and make unarmed melee attacks. Your head has a built-in [[Mesmetron]], which you can use to make ranged attacks. Your carry weight is 150 lbs., and it cannot be increased by your Strength or perks, but it can be increased by modified armor.

###### **Chryslus Highwayman**
>A restored pre-War car, the Highwayman is a tough piece of machinery, like the one reputed to have been driven by The Chosen One forty years ago. Indeed, it’s been restored to resemble that famous car by a local historian, who sold it to Mr. Bishop recently to pay off some debts. 
>
>The outside appearance has been well-restored as it was planned to be a museum display, but the inner workings haven’t been rebuilt to the same degree. It runs, but it’s somewhat unreliable and inefficient. However, old work- shops and garages along the highway may well provide opportunities to refit and upgrade the Highwayman during the course of the campaign.

###### **The Armored Van**
> Hurq’s van is an old military supply vehicle, built with dura- bility in mind over all things. It has interior locks for the main doors and a remote electronic lock that requires opening from the driver’s cab. Despite its heavy-duty construction, the Armored Van is not built for off-road usage and operates best on the road, even when that road is full of radioactive holes. 
> 
> The truck also has a working radio, which Hurq uses to communicate with the Valley of Fire base when he is returning, mainly so that Boulanger can temporarily deactivate the base’s defenses.

###### **MIM-72 Mobile Missile Launcher**
>  The MIM-72 is a pre-War tracked missile carrier. It can carry three people (one driver, one passenger, and one on the missile launcher assembly in back). The MIM-72 is similar to an armored truck, but the back is open, so it only provides cover to people inside the forward driving compartment. As with many military vehicles, it was modified so that its engine can switch between using gasoline or alcohol fuel. 
> 
> The MIM-72 normally performs short-range air defense, but the missiles can be direct-fired at stationary ground targets, such as important buildings in New Reno. Cho Dae, in an attempt to direct the Jaggers’ aggression but not give them a weapon too dangerous to control, has purposefully damaged the tracks for the MIM-72, rendering it unable to be repaired without significant effort, knowledge, and resources—things the Jaggers lack. 

> **MIM-72 SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE SYSTEM** 
> The MIM-72 surface-to-air missile launcher is installed on the back of the truck and can’t be carried by an individual, even a Super Mutant. Its missiles are not compatible with a person-portable missile launcher.
